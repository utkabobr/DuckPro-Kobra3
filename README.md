3. Unpack folder from it onto the FAT32 USB drive (Do not rename or move anything)
4. Power on the printer and wait it to boot
5. Plug USB drive into the printer

## Help! I'm stuck on 11407
This means that Klipper is failed to start.

First - don't worry, you can still re-flash stock firmware, then attempt to reinstall Duck Pro.

You need to re-flash stock firmware and then try again if you want.

Links to the stock firmware:
- [2.3.5.3](https://ytkab0bp.ru/Kobra3_2.3.5.3.swu)
- [2.3.3.9](https://ytkab0bp.ru/Kobra3_2.3.3.9.swu)

Place it as update.swu in that folder with strange symbols.
